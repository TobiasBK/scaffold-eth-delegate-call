# Understand Solidity's delegatecall using Scaffold-ETH

Scaffold-Eth is a powerful tool for developing fullstack applications fast. It allows you to easily vizualize the results of your Solidity code on the frontend. It's great for learning, allowing fast iteration.

Today we'll use Scaffold-eth to better undertand the delegatecall method in Solidity.

## Introduction

Solidity allows you to write smart contract code that can interact with the code of other smart contracts.

This contract-to-contract interation is known as a message call.

Message calls are similar to transactions on the blockchain. Each call has:

- a source
- a target
- payload data
- gas
- Ether
- return data

Called contracts get clean memory plus access to the call payload (termed **calldata**).

There is a special type of message call that uses the opcode `delegatecall`.

There is a big difference between regular `call` and `delegatecall`.

When a `delegatecall` is used **the code in the target contract is executed in the context of the calling contract.**

To clarify:

- `call`: When contractX executes a `call` to contractY, contractY's code will be executed with **contractY's** own storage variables.
- `delegatecall`: When a contractX executes a `delegatecall` to contractY, contractY's code will be executed with **contractX's** storage variables.

The goal of this repo is to review what this means using Solidity code examples and frontend visualization.

## Code execution in the EVM environment

Smart contracts executed in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) create a **context**.

The **context** is built from memory regions. Each region has a purpose:

- Code: Where instructions are stored. The EVM reads and executes the code as bytes.
- Stack: List of 32-byte elements. The stack has maximum limit of 1024 values. Parameters are placed on the top of the stack. Only top values are used.
- Memory: Only exists during code execution.
- Storage: A contracts persitent memory.
- Calldata: Data sent with a transaction, and immutable.
- Return data: Returned values after a call.

These memory regions together, called the **context**, are used differently in `call` and `delegatecall`.

## The code

In `/packages/hardhat/contracts` you'll find two different smart contracts...

# 🏄‍♂️ Quick Start

Prerequisites: [Node (v16 LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) plus [Yarn (v1.x)](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

> clone/fork 🏗 scaffold-eth:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth.git
```

> install and start your 👷‍ Hardhat chain:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth
yarn install
yarn chain
```

> in a second terminal window, start your 📱 frontend:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth
yarn start
```

> in a third terminal window, 🛰 deploy your contract:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth
yarn deploy
```

🔏 Edit your smart contract `YourContract.sol` in `packages/hardhat/contracts`

📝 Edit your frontend `App.jsx` in `packages/react-app/src`

💼 Edit your deployment scripts in `packages/hardhat/deploy`
